# blsmeta: Bayesian Location-Scale Meta-Analysis

Version 1 is forthcoming, say, by the end of June 2021.

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/blsmeta")
```

Note that the development version will be fully usable, in so far as it

functions over the coming weeks (merged from other branches),
culminating in the official release.
