# blsmeta: Bayesian Location-Scale Meta-Analysis

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.com/donaldRwilliams/blsmeta.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/donaldRwilliams/blsmeta)


Version 1 is forthcoming, say, by the end of June 2021. 


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/blsmeta")
```
Note that the development version will be fully usable, in so far 
as it will have been tested, documented, etc. It will gradually
include more functions over the coming weeks 
(merged from other branches), culminating in the official release.

Below, there are some simple examples demonstrating how to use **blsmeta**.
In the future, there will be several examples showcasing the utility
of scale modeling in meta-analysis.


## Installing JAGS
**blsmeta** uses the popular Bayesian software JAGS to estimate the models. 
It must be downloaded from the following link: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/)


## Packages
```
# install for data
if (!require('psymetadata')){
  install.packages('psymetadata')
  }
library(psymetadata)
library(blsmeta)
```

## Fixed-Effects Model
### Overall Effect
```
# fit model
fit_fe <- blsmeta(yi = yi, vi = vi, 
                  data = gnambs2020)
                  
# results
fit_fe

#> Model: Fixed-Effects
#> Studies: 67 
#> Samples: 20000 (4 chains)
#> Formula: ~ 1 
#> ------
#> Location:
#>             Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> (Intercept)     -0.07    0.03   -0.12   -0.02 1.00
#>
#> ------
#> Date: Mon Jun 07 12:03:56 2021 
```
There is an important difference from the **metafor** package, where, by default,
a random-effects model is fitted. This is not the case in **blsmeta**, where, by default, a fixed-effects model will be estimated if the level two variable is 
not provided.

### Moderator
```
fit_fe <- blsmeta(yi = yi, vi = vi, 
                  mods = ~ 0 + color,
                  data = gnambs2020)

# results
fit_fe

#> Model: Fixed-Effects
#> Studies: 67 
#> Samples: 20000 (4 chains)
#> Formula: ~ 0 + color 
#> ------
#> Location:
#>            Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> colorblack     -0.04    0.13   -0.30    0.22 1.00
#> colorblue      -0.04    0.07   -0.18    0.10 1.00
#> colorgray      -0.12    0.05   -0.22   -0.01 1.00
#> colorgreen     -0.06    0.03   -0.13    0.00 1.00
#> colorwhite      0.00    0.12   -0.23    0.22 1.00

#> ------
#> Date: Mon Jun 07 12:21:07 2021 
```
In the not too distant future (this was written on  6/7/21), it
will be possible to compare those effects (e.g., `colorgreen - colorwhite`).

## Two-Level Model
## Overall Effect
A two-level random-effects meta-analysis is implemented with

```
fit_re <- blsmeta(yi = yi, vi = vi, 
                  es_id = es_id,
                  data = gnambs2020)

# results
fit_re

#> Model: Two-Level
#> Studies: 67 
#> Samples: 20000 (4 chains)
#> Location Formula: ~ 1 
#> Scale Formula: ~ 1 
#> ------
#> Scale:
#>               Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> sd(Intercept)      0.10    0.06    0.02    0.22 1.00

#> Location:
#>             Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> (Intercept)     -0.08    0.03   -0.14   -0.02 1.00

#> ------
#> Date: Mon Jun 07 12:26:24 2021 
```
Notice the argument `es_id`, which corresponds to the effect size id 
(`1:k`, where `k` is the number of studies).

## Scale Moderator
It is possible to predict the between-study variance (or "scale"), that is,

```
fit_re <- blsmeta(yi = yi, vi = vi, 
                  es_id = es_id,
                  mods_scale2 = ~ n, 
                  data = gnambs2020)

# results
fit_re

#> Model: Two-Level
#> Studies: 67 
#> Samples: 20000 (4 chains)
#> Location Formula: ~ 1 
#> Scale Formula: ~ n 
#> ------
#> Scale:
#>             Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> (Intercept)      0.01    0.42   -0.77    0.88 1.03
#> n               -0.03    0.01   -0.05   -0.01 1.03

#> Location:
#>             Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> (Intercept)     -0.06    0.03   -0.11    0.00 1.00

#> ------
#> Date: Mon Jun 07 12:30:18 2021 
```
Notice that the `n` parameter is negative, implying that studies with larger 
sample sizes are more consistent (i.e., less heterogeneity). Soon, there
will be a function to predict that heterogeneity, say, at particular values
of `n` (this will also include uncertainty, which is a key advantage of 
Bayesian location-scale modeling)

## Three-Level Model
Three-level location-scale meta-analysis is fully implemented as well. The key is providing the `study_id` argument, which is the higher level grouping variable 
that the effect sizes are nested within. This accommodates dependent 
effect sizes.

More examples coming soon :-)

## MCMC metafor
The package **metafor** is perhaps the gold-standard for 
meta-analysis in `R`. In **blsmeta**, it is possible to sample from the 
posterior distribution of a model originally estimated with **metafor** 
(`rma` objects are currently supported).

```
library(metafor)

fit <- mcmc_rma(rma(yi = yi, vi = vi, 
                 method = "FE", data = gnambs2020), 
                 data = gnambs2020)
# results
fit

#> Model: Fixed-Effects
#> Studies: 67 
#> Samples: 20000 (4 chains)
#> Formula: ~ 1 
#> ------
#> Location:
#>             Post.mean Post.sd Cred.lb Cred.ub Rhat
#> (Intercept)     -0.07    0.03   -0.12   -0.02 1.00

#> ------
#> Date: Mon Jun 07 13:27:13 2021 
```
This function works for any kind of model fitted with `rma`.
