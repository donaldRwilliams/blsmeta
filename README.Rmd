# blsmeta: Bayesian Location-Scale Meta-Analysis

Version 1 is forthcoming, say, by the end of June 2021. 


You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/blsmeta")
```

Note that the development version will be fully usable, in so far 
as it will have been tested, documented, etc. It will gradually
include more functions over the coming weeks 
(merged from other branches), culminating in the official release.
